# Hey there! 

I'm **Sebastian**, currently a foreign exchange student soaking up the American High School live in **Houston, Texas**. When I'm not hitting the books, you'll find me diving into the world of tech, experimenting with **JAVA**, **MySQL** and frontend **Web Development** to whip up practical applications.

Beyond the digital realm, I'm all about chasing **tennis** balls on the courtâ€”it's my game. Hiking is another love of mine; there's something magical about nature that keeps me grounded. And, oh, did I mention I'm into freezing moments in time through photography? Check out my work on [here](https://sebastian-sonne.com/media)!

Let's connect and share the journey, whether it's coding adventures, acing a serve, or capturing the beauty of the world one photo at a time.
